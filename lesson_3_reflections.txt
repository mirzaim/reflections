When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    when I want to get back up from my files or when I want working togher on same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    because some commmits related to other and some times I want to push a group of commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    when I want get a copy of a project on local device and work on it, I would clone it.
    but when I want have a copy of project on my github account I fork that project.
    when I want to check new feature or add new version for project, branches are very useful.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    It's needed when you want to push your changes into github and you can also understand what others do.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    by local shared network but it's very hard.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
   when I want to add new feature to my project and ask about that from others.
   when I do all things in master branch the process of commiting is easier but for big group that work on same project it's not good.
