When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    when I want to get back up from my files or when I want working togher on same project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    because some commmits related to other and some times I want to push a group of commits.
